VERSION_NUMBER="0.3.0"
VERSION_DATE="13 Feb 2014"

#
# Script to generate a scrolling spectrum waterfall plot from a MP3 audio file.
# Author: Joe Desbonnet, jdesbonnet@gmail.com
# Version 0.3, 13 Feb 2014.
#
# Dependencies:
# * SoX audio tool
# * GNU Parallel (optional)
# * mp3info
# * ffmpeg
#
# There are a few problems with this script:
# You'll need to edit to change title/credit on plot. TODO move to command line
# I've used mencoder to assemble the PNG files into a video, but I find the
# a/v sync is off. However if converted to H.264 mp4 with ffmpeg it's fine.
# Ideally I'd like to create the video with just ffmpeg, but for some reason
# the version of ffmpeg I have is not working in PNG->video mode.
# Also the version of GNU Parallel in the Ubuntu (13.04) repo doesn't work:
# need to download latest version and update the PARALLEL config below.
# The current implementation is very resource intensive. In particular you
# need *lots* of temporary disk space. This can be improved by generating
# the video in fragments and deleting the PNG files after a fragment is
# generated.
#
# See this blog post for more information:
# http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.ie/2014/02/convert-mp3-to-scrolling-spectrum.html
#
# RELEASE NOTES:
# Version 0.1, 7 Feb 2014:
# First release. Some parameters hard coded and required script edit to change.
#
# Version 0.2 11 Feb 2014:
# Make all important parameters configurable from the command line with switches
# such as -t <title> -r <frame-per-second> etc. Display help if no parameters
# given: full documenation in usage function.
#
# Version 0.3 13 Feb 2014:
# Eliminate need for mencoder. Encode once using ffmpeg. Tested with v2.1.3.
# Option to change output video file name with -o. Defaults to output.mp4



# Display help text
function usage() {
cat <<EOF
./make-waterfall-video.sh options... <mp3file>

Options:

 -c <credit> : will be displayed at bottom left (default credit to this script)
 -t <title> : will be displayed centered on top (default none)
 -d <seconds> : width of the spectrogram in seconds. Determines scroll speed. (default 1)
 -r <frames-per-second> : Video frame rate (default 30)
 -o <output-file> : name of output mp4 file (default output.mp4)
 -h : display this message and exit
 -v : display version and exit
